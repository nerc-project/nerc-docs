# OpenShift Overview

OpenShift is a multifaceted, container orchestration platform from Red Hat.
OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform.
NERC offers a cloud development **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** solution based
on Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform that provides isolated, multi-tenant
containers for application development and deployment. This is optimized for
continuous containerized application development and multi-tenant deployment
which allows you and your team to focus on solving your research problems and
not infrastructure management.

## Basic Components and Glossary of common terms

OpenShift is a container orchestration platform that provides a number of components
and tools to help you build, deploy, and manage applications. Here are some of the
basic components of OpenShift:

- **Project**: A project is a logical grouping of resources in the NERC's OpenShift
  platform that provides isolation from others resources.

- **Nodes**: Nodes are the physical or virtual machines that run the applications
  and services in your OpenShift cluster.

- **Image**: An image is a non-changing, definition of file structures and programs
  for running an application.

- **Container**: A container is an instance of an image with the addition of other
  operating system components such as networking and running programs. Containers
  are used to run applications and services in OpenShift.

- **Pods**: Pods are the smallest deployable units defined, deployed, and managed
  in OpenShift, that group related one or more containers that need to share resources.

- **Services**: Services are logical representations of a set of pods that provide
  a network endpoint for access to the application or service. Services can be
  used to load balance traffic across multiple pods, and they can be accessed
  using a stable DNS name. Services are assigned an IP address and port and proxy
  connections to backend pods. This allows the pods to change while the connection
  details of the service remain consistent.

- **Volume**: A volume is a persistent file space available to pods and containers
  for storing data. Containers are immutable and therefore upon a restart any
  contents are cleared and reset to the original state of the image used to create
  the container. Volumes provide storage space for files that need to persist
  through container restarts.

- **Routes**: Routes can be used to expose services to external clients to connections
  outside the platform. A route is assigned a name in DNS when set up to make it
  easily accessible. They can be configured with custom hostnames and TLS certificates.

- **Replication Controllers**: A replication controller (rc) is a built-in mechanism
  that ensures a defined number of pods are running at all times. An asset that
  indicates how many pod replicas are required to run at a time. If a pod unexpectedly
  quits or is deleted, a new copy of the pod is created and started. Additionally,
  if more pods are running than the defined number, the replication controller
  will delete the extra pods to get down to the defined number.

- **Namespace**: A Namespace is a way to logically isolate resources within the
  Cluster. In our case every project gets an unique namespace.

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: A key security control to ensure that cluster
  users and workloads have only access to resources required to execute their roles.

- **Deployment Configurations**: A deployment configuration (dc) is an extension
  of a replication controller that is used to push out a new version of application
  code. Deployment configurations are used to define the process of deploying
  applications and services to OpenShift. Deployment configurations
  can be used to specify the number of replicas, the resources required by the
  application, and the deployment strategy to use.

- **Application URL Components**: When an application developer adds an application
  to a project, a unique DNS name is created for the application via a Route. All
  application DNS names will have a hyphen separator between your application name
  and your unique project namespace. If the application is a web application, this
  DNS name is also used for the URL to access the application. All names are in
  the form of `<appname>-<mynamespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.
  For example: `mytestapp-mynamespace.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.
