# User Account Types

NERC offers two types of user accounts: a **Principal Investigator (PI) Account**
and a **General User Account**. All General Users must be assigned by a PI to their
approved project by an active NERC PI account or by delegated manager(s).

!!! question "Principal Investigator Eligibility Information"
    - MGHPCC consortium members, whereby they enter into an service agreement with
    MGHPCC for the NERC services.

    - Non-members of MGHPCC can also be PIs of NERC Services, but must also have an active non-member agreement with MGHPCC.

    - External research focused institutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are subject to an external customer cost structure.

PI accounts are able to request Resource Allocations. A PI account enables a user
to log into NERC's computational project space; apply for allocations of NERC resources
and grant access to other users; and delegate responsibilities to other collaborators
from the same institutions or elsewhere as managers using
[NERCâ€™s ColdFront interface](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/).

## Getting Started

Any faculty, staff, student, and external collaborator must request a user account
through the [MGHPCC Shared Services (MGHPCC-SS) Account Portal](https://regapp.mss.mghpcc.org/).
This is a web-based, single point-of-entry to the NERC system that displays a user
welcome page. The welcome page of the account registration site displays instructions
on how to register a General User account on NERC, which are shown in the image below:

![MGHPCC Shared Services (MGHPCC-SS) Account Portal Welcome Page](images/regapp-welcome-page.png)

There are two options: either register for a new account or to manage an existing
one. If you are new to NERC and want to register as a new MGHPCC-SS user, click
on the "Register for an Account" button. This will redirect you to a new web page
which shows details about how to register for a new MGHPCC-SS user account. NERC
uses **CILogon** that supports login either using your Institutional Identity
Provider (IdP).

Clicking the "Begin MGHPCC-SS Account Creation Process" button will initiate the
account creation process. You will be redirected to a site managed by CILogon where
you will select your institutional or commercial identity provider as shown below:

![CILogon Page](images/CILogon.png)

Once selected, you will be redirected to your institutional or commercial identity
provider where you will login as shown here:

![Institutional IdP Login Page](images/institutional_idp.png)

At the completion of that logon, your browser will be redirected to the MGHPCC-SS
Account Management site where you will complete your MGHPCC-SS account creation process.

After successful logon, your browser will redirect back to the MGHPCC-SS Registration
Page and ask for review and confirmation of creating your account with fetched information
to complete the account creation process.

!!! warning "Very Important"
    If you don't click the "Create MGHPCC-SS Account" button, your account will not
    be created! So this is a very important step, to review and also click on the
    "Create MGHPCC-SS Account" button to save your information.

You can make any corrections that you need and fill in any blank fields i.e. "Research
Domain" and then click the "Create MGHPCC-SS Account" button. This will automatically
send an email to your email address with a link to validate and confirm your account
information.

Once you get an email and click on the provided validation web link, you will make
sure that your user account is created and valid by viewing the following page:

!!! question "Help"
    If you have an institutional identity, it's preferable that you use that identity
    to create your MGHPCC-SS account. Institutional identities are vetted by identity
    management teams and provide a higher level of confidence to resource owners
    when granting access to resources. You can only link one university account to
    a MGHPCC-SS account; if you have multiple university accounts you will only be
    able to link one of those accounts to your MGHPCC-SS account. If at a later date,
    you want to change which account is connected to your MGHPCC-SS identity you
    can by contacting [help@nese.mghpcc.org](mailto:help@nese.mghpcc.org?subject=NERC%20User%20Account%Help).

## How to update and modify your MGHPCC-SS account information?

2. Click on "Manage Your MGHPCC-SS Account" button

3. Review your currently saved account information, change any fields that require

4. This will send an email to verify your updated account information so check your
