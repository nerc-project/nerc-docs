# Virtual Machine Image Guide

An OpenStack Compute cloud needs to have virtual machine images in order to
launch an instance. A virtual machine image is a single file which contains a
virtual disk that has a bootable operating system installed on it.

!!!warning "Very Important"
    The provided Windows Server 2022 R2 image is for evaluation only. This evaluation
    edition expires in **180 days**. This is intended to evaluate if the product
    is right for you. This is on *user discretion* to update, extend, and handle
    licensing issues for future usages.

## Existing Microsoft Windows Image

Cloudbase Solutions provides [Microsoft Windows Server 2022 R2 Standard
Evaluation for OpenStack](https://cloudbase.it/windows-cloud-images/). This
includes the required support for hypervisor-specific drivers (Hyper-V / KVM).
Also integrated are the guest initialization tools (Cloudbase-Init), security
updates, proper performance, and security configurations as well as the final Sysprep.

## How to Build and Upload your custom Microsoft Windows Image

!!!note "Overall Process"
    To create a new image, you will need the installation CD or DVD ISO file for
    the guest operating system. You will also need access to a virtualization tool.
    You can use KVM hypervisor for this. Or, if you have a GUI desktop virtualization
    tool (such as, [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/), VMware Fusion or
    VirtualBox), you can use that instead. Convert the file to **QCOW2** (KVM, Xen)
    once you are done.

You can customize and build the new image manually on your own system and then
upload the image to the NERC's OpenStack Compute cloud. Please follow the following
steps which describes how to obtain, create, and modify virtual machine images that
are compatible with the NERC's OpenStack.

1. Follow these steps to prepare the installation:

    a. Download a Windows Server 2022 installation ISO file. Evaluation images are
    available on the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022)
    (**registration required**).

    b. Download the signed **VirtIO drivers** ISO file from the [Fedora website](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-windows-virtual-machines-using-virtio-drivers/index.html).

    c. Install [Virtual Machine Manager](https://virt-manager.org/download/) on your
    local Windows 10 machine using WSL:

    - **Enable WSL on your local Windows 10 subsystem for Linux:**
        The steps given here are straightforward, however, before following them
        make sure on your Windows 10, you have WSL enabled and have at least Ubuntu
        20.04 or above LTS version running over it. If you donâ€™t know how to do
        that then see our tutorial on [how to enable WSL and install Ubuntu over
        it](https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/enable-windows-subsystem-linux-feature.html).

    - **Download and install MobaXterm:**
        **MobaXterm** is a free application that can be downloaded using [this link](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html).
        After downloading, install it like any other normal Windows software.

    - **Open MobaXterm and run WSL Linux:**
        As you open this advanced terminal for Windows 10, WSL installed Ubuntu
        app will show on the left side panel of it. Double click on that to start
        the WSL session.

        ![MobaXterm WSL Ubuntu-20.04 LTS](images/a.mobaxterm_ubuntu_WSL.png)

    - **Install Virt-Manager:**

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install virt-manager

    - **Run Virtual Machine Manager:**
        Start the Virtual Machine Manager running this command on the opened
        terminal: `virt-manager` as shown below:

        ![MobaXterm start Virt-Manager](images/b.mobaxterm_init_virt-manager.png)

        This will open Virt-Manager as following:

        ![Virt-Manager interface](images/0.virtual-manager.png)

    - **Connect QEMU/KVM user session on Virt-Manager:**

        ![Virt-Manager Add Connection](images/0.0.add_virtual_connection.png)

        ![Virt-Manager QEMU/KVM user session](images/0.1.select_qemu_kvm_user_session.png)

        ![Virt-Manager Connect](images/0.2.qemu_kvm_user_session.png)

2. Create a virtual machine with the storage set to a **15 GB** *qcow2* disk
image using Virtual Machine Manager.

    ![Virt-Manager New Virtual Machine](images/1.new_virtual_machine.png)

    ![Virt-Manager Local install media](images/2.select_local_ISO_image.png)

11. The Sysprep will generate **QCOW2** image i.e. `win2k22.qcow2` on `/home/<YourUserName>/.local/share/libvirt/images/`

    ![Windows QCOW2 Image](images/download_icow2_win2022_image.png)

12. You can copy/download this windows image to the folder where you configured
your OpenStack CLI as described [Here](../openstack-cli/openstack-CLI.md) and
upload to the NERC's OpenStack running the following OpenStack Image API command:

    `$ openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --file win2k22.qcow2 MS-Windows-2022`

    You can verify the uploaded image is available by running:

    `$ openstack image list`

        +--------------------------------------+---------------------+--------+
        | ID                                   | Name                | Status |
