# Using Your Data Science Project (DSP)

You can access your current projects by navigating to the "Data Science Projects"
menu item on the left-hand side, as highlighted in the figure below:

![Data Science Projects](images/data-science-projects.png)

If you have any existing projects, they will be displayed here. These projects
correspond to your [NERC-OCP (OpenShift) resource allocations](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-details.md#general-user-view-of-openshift-resource-allocation).

!!! note "Why we need Data Science Project (DSP)?"

    To implement a data science workflow, you must use a data science project.
    Projects allow you and your team to organize and collaborate on resources
    within separated namespaces. From a project you can create multiple workbenches,
    each with their own Jupyter notebook environment, and each with their own data
    connections and cluster storage. In addition, the workbenches can share models
    and data with pipelines and model servers.

## Selecting your data science project

Here, you can click on specific projects corresponding to the appropriate allocation
where you want to work. This brings you to your selected data science project's
details page, as shown below:

![Data Science Project's Details](images/data-science-project-details.png)

Within the data science project, you can add the following configuration options:

- **Workbenches**: Development environments within your project where you can access
  notebooks and generate models.

- **Cluster storage**: Storage for your project in your OpenShift cluster.

- **Data connections**: A list of data sources that your project uses.

- **Pipelines**: A list of created and configured pipeline servers.

- **Models and model servers**: A list of models and model servers that your project
  uses.

As you can see in the project's details figure, our selected data science project
currently has no workbenches, storage, data connections, pipelines, or model servers.

## Populate the data science project with a Workbench

Add a workbench by clicking the Create workbench button as shown below:

![Create Workbench](images/create-workbench.png)

!!! info "What are Workbenches?"

    Workbenches are development environments. They can be based on JupyterLab, but
    also on other types of IDEs, like VS Code or RStudio. You can create as many
    workbenches as you want, and they can run concurrently.

On the Create workbench page, complete the following information.

**Note**: Not all fields are required.

- Name

- Description

- Notebook image (Image selection)

- Deployment size (Container size and Number of GPUs)

- Environment variables

- Cluster storage name

- Cluster storage description

- Persistent storage size

- Data connections

!!! tip "How to specify CPUs, Memory, and GPUs for your JupyterLab workbench?"

    You have the option to select different container sizes to define compute
    resources, including CPUs and memory. Each container size comes with pre-configured
    CPU and memory resources.

    Optionally, you can specify the desired **Number of GPUs** depending on the
    nature of your data analysis and machine learning code requirements. However,
    this number should not exceed the GPU quota specified by the value of the
    "**OpenShift Request on GPU Quota**" attribute that has been approved for
    this "**NERC-OCP (OpenShift)**" resource allocation on NERC's ColdFront, as
    [described here](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-details.md#pi-and-manager-allocation-view-of-openshift-resource-allocation).

    If you need to increase this quota value, you can request a change as
    [explained here](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-change-request.md#request-change-resource-allocation-attributes-for-openshift-project).

Once you have entered the information for your workbench, click **Create**.

![Fill Workbench Information](images/tensor-flow-workbench.png)

For our example project, let's name it "Tensorflow Workbench". We'll select the
**TensorFlow** image, choose a **Deployment size** of **Small**, **Number of GPUs**
as **1** and allocate a **Cluster storage** space of **1GB**.

!!! info "More About Cluster Storage"

    Cluster storage consists of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), which are
    persistent storage spaces available for storing your notebooks and data. You
    can create PVCs directly from here and mount them in your workbenches as
    needed. It's worth noting that a default cluster storage (PVC) is automatically
    created with the same name as your workbench to save your work.

After creating the workbench, you will return to your project page. It shows the
status of the workbench as shown below:

![Workbench and Cluster Storage](images/workbench-cluster-storage.png)

Notice that under the status indicator the workbench is _Running_. However, if any
issues arise, such as an "exceeded quota" error, a red exclamation mark will appear
under the Status indicator, as shown in the example below:

![Workbench Error Status](images/workbench-error-status.png)

You can hover over that icon to view details. Upon closer inspection of the error
message and the "Event log", you will receive details about the issue, enabling
you to resolve it accordingly.

When your workbench is ready and the status changes to _Running_, you can select
"Open" to access your environment:

![Open JupyterLab Environment](images/open-tensorflow-jupyter-lab.png)

!!! tip "How can I start or stop a Workbench?"

    You can use this "toggle switch" under the "Status" section to easily _start/stop_
    this environment later on.
