# Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) Overview

RHOAI offers a versatile and scalable MLOps solution equipped with tools for
rapid constructing, deploying, and overseeing AI-driven applications. Integrating
the proven features of both Red Hat OpenShift AI and Red Hat OpenShift creates a
comprehensive enterprise-grade artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
application platform, facilitating collaboration among data scientists, engineers,
and app developers. This consolidated platform promotes consistency, security,
and scalability, fostering seamless teamwork across disciplines and empowering
teams to quickly explore, build, train, deploy, test machine learning models, and
scale AI-enabled intelligent applications.

Formerly known as Red Hat OpenShift Data Science, OpenShift AI facilitates the
complete journey of AI/ML experiments and models. OpenShift AI enables data
acquisition and preparation, model training and fine-tuning, model serving and
model monitoring, hardware acceleration, and distributed workloads using
graphics processing unit (GPU) resources.

## AI for All

Recent enhancements to Red Hat OpenShift AI include:

- Implementation **Deployment pipelines** for monitoring AI/ML experiments and
  automating ML workflows accelerate the iteration process for data scientists
  and developers of intelligent applications. This integration facilitates swift
  iteration on machine learning projects and embeds automation into application
  deployment and updates.

- **Model serving** now incorporates GPU assistance for inference tasks and custom
  model serving runtimes, enhancing inference performance and streamlining the
  deployment of foundational models.

- With **Model monitoring**, organizations can oversee performance and operational
  metrics through a centralized dashboard, enhancing management capabilities.
