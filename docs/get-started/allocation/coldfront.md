# What is NERC's ColdFront?

NERC uses [NERC's ColdFront interface](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/), an
open source resource allocation management system called
[ColdFront](https://github.com/ubccr/coldfront) to provide a single point-of-entry
for administration, reporting, and measuring scientific impact of NERC resources
for PI.

## How to get access to NERC's ColdFront

Any users who had registerd their user accounts through the
[MGHPCC Shared Services (MGHPCC-SS) Account Portal](https://regapp.mss.mghpcc.org/)
also known as **"RegApp"** can get access to [NERC's ColdFront interface](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/).

General Users who are not PIs or Managers on a project see a read-only view of
the NERC's ColdFront as [described here](allocation-details.md#general-user-view).

Whereas, once a [PI Account request](https://nerc.mghpcc.org/pi-account-request/)
is granted, the PI will receive an email confirming the request approval and
how to connect NERC's ColdFront.

PI or project managers can use NERC's ColdFront as a self-service web-portal that
can see an administrative view of it as
[described here](../allocation/allocation-details.md#pi-and-manager-view) and can
do the following tasks:

- **Only PI** can add a new project and archive any existing project(s)

- Manage existing projects

- Request allocations that fall under projects in NERC's resources such as clusters,
  cloud resources, servers, storage, and software licenses

- Add/remove user access to/from allocated resources who is a member of the project
  without requiring system administrator interaction

- Elevate selected users to 'manager' status, allowing them to handle some of the
  PI asks such as request new resource allocations, add/remove users to/from resource
  allocations, add project data such as grants and publications

- Monitor resource utilization such as storage and cloud usage

- Receive email notifications for expiring/renewing access to resources as well
  as notifications when allocations change status - i.e. Active, Active (Needs
  Renewal), Denied, Expired

- Provide information such as grants, publications, and other reportable data for
  periodic review by center director to demonstrate need for the resources
