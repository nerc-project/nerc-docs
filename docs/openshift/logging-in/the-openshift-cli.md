# OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) Tools Overview

With the OpenShift CLI, the **oc** command, you can create applications and manage
OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal.

The web console provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing your projects
and applications. There are, however, some tasks that can only be performed using
a command-line tool called _oc_.

The OpenShift CLI is ideal in the following situations:

- Working directly with project source code

- Scripting OpenShift Container Platform operations

- Managing projects while restricted by bandwidth resources and the web console
  is unavailable

It is recommended that developers should be comfortable with simple command-line
tasks and the the NERC's OpenShift command-line tool.
