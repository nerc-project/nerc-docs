# Minio

[Minio](https://min.io/) is an open-source, high-performance object storage server
compatible with the Amazon S3 API. It provides reliable and scalable storage for
cloud-native applications, big data, and AI workloads.

MinIO offers several key features:

-   **High Performance**: MinIO is optimized for high throughput and low latency,
making it suitable for large-scale object storage deployments.

-   **Scalability**: It can handle petabytes of data and thousands of concurrent
users, allowing you to scale your storage needs as required.

-   **Reliability**: MinIO ensures data durability and availability with built-in
replication and erasure coding capabilities.

-   **Security**: It supports encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring the
confidentiality and integrity of your data.

-   **Integration**: MinIO is compatible with the Amazon S3 API, making it easy
to migrate existing applications and workflows to MinIO.

## Deploying Minio in Your OpenShift Project

You can run a script that automates the setup of a local S3 storage (MinIO) by completing
the following tasks:  

-   **Deploys a MinIO instance** in your project namespace.

-   **Generates a random user ID and password** for the MinIO Console.

-   Installs all required **network policies**.

**Procedure**:

1.  From the OpenShift AI dashboard, you can return to OpenShift Web Console
    by using the application launcher icon (the black-and-white icon that looks
    like a grid), and choosing the "OpenShift Console" as shown below:

2.  From your [NERC's OpenShift Web Console](https://console.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org/),
    navigate to your project corresponding to the _NERC RHOAI Data Science Project_
    and select the "Import YAML" button, represented by the "+" icon in the top
    navigation bar as shown below:

3.  Verify that you selected the correct project.

    !!! warning "Very Important Note"

        In this YAML file, the size of the storage is set as 10Gi. Change it if
        you need to.

5.  Click **Create**.

**Verification**:

i. Once Resource is successfully created, you will see a "Resources successfully
created" message and the following resources listed:

![Resources successfully created Importing More YAML](images/minio-yaml-import-success.png)

ii. Once the deployment is successful, you will be able to see all resources
are created and grouped under "minio" application grouping on the
**Topology View** menu, as shown below:

![MinIO Under Topology](images/minio-topology.png)

Once successfully initiated, click on the **minio** deployment and select the
"Resources" tab to review created *Pods*, *Services*, and *Routes*.

![MinIO Deployemnt Resources](images/minio-deployment-resources.png)

Please note the **minio-console** route URL by navigating to the "Routes" section
under the _Location_ path. When you click on the **minio-console** route URL, it
will open the MinIO web console that looks like below:

![MinIO Web Console](images/minio-web-console.png)

!!! info "MinIO Web Console Login Credential"

    For this, you need to install and configure the OpenShift CLI by following
    the [setup instructions](../../openshift/logging-in/setup-the-openshift-cli.md#installing-the-openshift-cli).

    Once the OpenShift CLI is set up, the Username and Password for the MinIO web
    console can be retrieved by running the following `oc` commands:

    i. To get *Access key* run:

    `oc get secret minio-root-user -o template --template '{{.data.MINIO_ROOT_USER}}' | base64 --decode`

    ii. And to get *Secret key* run:

    `oc get secret minio-root-user -o template --template '{{.data.MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD}}' | base64 --decode`  

Return to the **MinIO Web Console** using the provided URL. Enter the **Access Key**
as the **Username** and the **Secret Key** as the **Password**.

!!! note "Alternatively, Running a script to install local MinIO object storage"

    Alternatively, you can run a script to install local object storage using the
    OpenShift CLI (`oc`). Once the OpenShift CLI is set up, execute the following
    command to install MinIO object storage along with local S3 storage (MinIO):

    `oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc/main/setup/s3-basic.yaml`

!!! tip "Clean Up"

    To delete all resources if not necessary just run `oc delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc/main/setup/s3-basic.yaml`
    or `oc delete all,sa,rolebindings,pvc,job -l app=minio`.

!!! danger "Important Note"

    The script is based on a [guide for deploying MinIO](https://ai-on-openshift.io/tools-and-applications/minio/minio/).
    The MinIO-based Object Storage that the script creates is not meant for production usage.
