# DNS services in NERC OpenStack

## What is DNS?

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a ranked and distributed system for naming resources
connected to a network, and works by storing various types of record, such as an
IP address associated with a domain name.

DNS simplifies the communication between computers and servers through a network
and provides a user-friendly method for users to interact with and get the desired
information.

## How to get user-friendly domain names for your NERC VMs?

NERC does not currently offer integrated domain name service management.

You can use one of the following methods to configure name resolution (DNS) for
your NERC's virtual instances.

### 1. Using freely available free Dynamic DNS services

Get a free domain or host name from [no-ip.com](https://www.noip.com/) or other

[free Dynamic DNS services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-best-dynamic-dns-providers-can-lookup-free-today/).

Here we will describe how to use No-IP to configure dynamic DNS.

**Step 1: Create your No-IP Account.**

During this process you can add your desired unique hostname with pre-existing
domain name or you can choose to create your hostname later on.

**Step 2: Confirm Your Account by verifing your email address.**

![Activate Your Account](images/activate-your-account.png)

**Step 3: Log In to Your Account to view your dashboard.**

**Step 4: Add Floating IP of your instance to the Hostname.**

Click on "Modify" to add your own Floating IP attached to your NERC virtual instance.

Then, browse your host or domain name as you setup during registration or later
i.e. [http://nerc.hopto.org](http://nerc.hopto.org) on above example.

Easy video tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eeMxhpT868).

Having a free option is great for quick demonstrate your project but this has
the following restrictions:

### 2. Using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/)

You can setup [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) on one of
your NERC VMs and then use this Nginx Proxy Manager as your gateway to forward
to your other web based services.

#### Quick Setup

i. [Launch a VM](../../create-and-connect-to-the-VM/launch-a-VM.md)
with a security group that has opened rule for port **80**, **443** and **22** to
enable [SSH Port Forwarding, aka SSH Tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example)
i.e. **Local Port Forwarding** into the VM.

ii. [SSH into your VM](../../create-and-connect-to-the-VM/ssh-to-the-VM.md)
using your private key after [attaching a Floating IP](../../create-and-connect-to-the-VM/assign-a-floating-IP.md).

iii. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
based on your OS choice for your VM.

iv. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file similar to this:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
    app:
        image: "jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest"
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "81:81"
            - "443:443"
        volumes:
            - ./data:/data
            - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

v. Bring up your stack by running:

```sh
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d
```

vi. Once the docker container runs successfully, connect to it on Admin Web Port
i.e. **81** opened for the admin interface via SSH Tunneling i.e. **Local Port Forwarding**
from your local machine's terminal by running:

`ssh -N -L <Your_Preferred_Port>:localhost:81 <User>@<Floating-IP> -i <Path_To_Your_Private_Key>`

Here, you can choose any port that is available on your machine as `<Your_Preferred_Port>`
and then VM's assigned Floating IP as `<Floating-IP>` and associated Private
Key pair attached to the VM as `<Path_To_Your_Private_Key>`.

For e.g. `ssh -N -L 8081:localhost:81 ubuntu@199.94.60.24 -i ~/.ssh/cloud.key`

vii. Once the SSH Tunneling is successful, log in to the Nginx Proxy Manager
Admin UI on your web browser:
`http://localhost:<Your_Preferred_Port>` i.e. `http://localhost:8081`

!!! info "Information"

    It may take some time to spin up the Admin UI. Your terminal running the SSH
    Tunneling i.e. Local Port Forwarding will not show any logs or output when
    successfully done. Also your should not close or terminate the terminal while
    runnng the tunneling sessions and using the Admin UI.

Default Admin User:

```sh
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify
your admin details and change your password.

#### How to create a Proxy Host with Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate attached to it

i. Click on Hosts >> Proxy Hosts, then click on "Add Proxy Host" button as shown
below:

![Add Proxy Hosts](images/nginx-proxy-manager-proxy-host.png)

ii. On the popup box, enter your Domain Names (This need to be registed from your
research institution or purchased on other third party vendor services and your have
its administrative access)

!!! note "Important Note"

    The Domain Name need to have an **A Record** pointing to the public floating
    IP of your NERC VM where you are hosting the Nginx Proxy Manager!

Please fill out the following information on this popup box:

- Scheme: _http_

- Forward Hostname/IP:
  _`<The Private-IP of your NERC VM where you are hosting the web services>`_

- Forward Port: _`<Port exposed on your VM to the public>`_

- Enable all toggles i.e. Cache Assets, Block Common Exploits, Websockets Support

- Access List: _Publicly Accessible_

For your reference, you can review your selection should looks like below with your
own Domain Name and other settings:

![Add Proxy Hosts Settings](images/nginx-proxy-manager-add-proxy-host.png)

Also, select the **SSL** tab and then "Request a new SSL Certificate" with settings
as shown below:

![Add Proxy Hosts SSL Settings](images/nginx-proxy-manager-ssl-setting.png)

iii. Once Saved clicking the "Save" button. It should show you Status "Online" and
when you click on the created Proxy Host link it will load the web services with
https and domain name you defined i.e. `https://<Your-Domain-Name>`.

### 3. Using your local Research Computing (RC) department or academic institution's Central IT services

You need to contact and work with your Research Computing department or
academic institution's Central IT services to create **A record** for your hostname
that maps to the address of a Floating IP of your NERC virtual instance.

**A record:** The primary DNS record used to connect your domain to an IP address
that directs visitors to your website.

### 4. Using commercial DNS providers

Alternatively, you can purchase a fully registered domain name or host name from
commercial hosting providers and then register DNS records for your virtual instance
from commercial cloud servies i.e. AWS Route53, Azure DNS, CloudFlare, Google Cloud
Platform, GoDaddy, etc.
