# What is Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline?

A Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline involves a series of
steps that is performed in order to deliver a new version of application. CI/CD
pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery using automation.

## Components of a CI/CD pipeline

The steps that form a CI/CD pipeline are distinct subsets of tasks that are
grouped into a pipeline stage. Typical pipeline stages include:

- **Build** - The stage where the application is compiled.
- **Test** - The stage where code is tested. Automation here can save both time
and effort.
- **Release** - The stage where the application is delivered to the central repository.
- **Deploy** - In this stage code is deployed to production environment.
- **Validation and compliance** - The steps to validate a build are determined by
the needs of your organization. Image security scanning, security scanning and
code analysis of applications ensure the quality of images and written application's
code.
