# Object Detection Application Using YOLOv5 Model

Here you will use an example Object Detection Application using YOLOv5 model to
complete the following tasks:

-   Data Preparation by downloading dataset images and randomly split them in train/validate/test.

-   Train model with YOLOv5 and test it.

-   Export YoloV5 model to ONNX format.

-   Save the Model to the S3 Object storage.

-   Deploy the model by using OpenShift AI model serving.

-   Use the gRPC and REST inference endpoints to query the model.

## About the YOLOv5 model

**YOLO(You Only Look Once)** is one of the leading object detection algorithms,
leveraging deep learning techniques to achieve high speed and accuracy. Unlike
the **R-CNN(Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)** model, YOLO takes a
different approach by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding
boxes within each grid cell. This method simplifies the process of determining
object class probabilities.

By using a single-stage detection model, YOLO processes the entire image in one
pass, making it significantly faster than traditional models. Due to its efficiency,
YOLO is well-suited for real-time applications.

[YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/), which further improved the
model's performance and added new features such as support for panoptic
segmentation and object tracking.

YOLO has been widely applied across various fields, including autonomous vehicles,
security and surveillance, and medical imaging.

## Navigating to the OpenShift AI dashboard

Please follow [these steps](../logging-in/access-the-rhoai-dashboard.md) to access
the NERC OpenShift AI dashboard.

## Setting up your Data Science Project in the NERC RHOAI

**Prerequisites**:

-   Before proceeding, confirm that you have an active GPU quota that has been approved
    for your current NERC OpenShift Allocation through NERC ColdFront. Read
    more about [How to Access GPU Resources](../../openshift/gpus/intro-to-gpus-on-nerc-ocp.md#accessing-gpu-resources)
    on NERC OpenShift Allocation.

## 1. Storing data with connection

For this tutorial, you will need **two S3-compatible object storage buckets**,
such as **NERC OpenStack Container (Ceph)**, **MinIO**, or **AWS S3**. You can
either use your own storage buckets or run a provided script that automatically
creates the following **local S3 storage (MinIO) bucket**:

-   **my-storage** â€“ Use this bucket to store your models and data. You can reuse
this bucket and its connection for notebooks and model servers.

### 1.1. **Using your own S3-compatible storage buckets**

**Procedure**:

Manually create a data connection: **My Storage** by following
[How to create a data connection](../data-science-project/model-serving-in-the-rhoai.md#create-a-data-connection).

**Verification**:

You should see a data connection listed under your RHOAI Dashboard **My Storage**
as shown below:

![Data Connections](images/single-data-connection.png)

### 1.2. **Using a script to set up local S3 storage (MinIO)**

Alternatively, if you want to run a script that automates the setup by completing
the following tasks:

-   **Deploys a MinIO instance** in your project namespace.

-   **Creates one storage buckets** within the MinIO instance.

-   **Generates a random user ID and password** for the MinIO Console.

-   **Establishes a data connection** in your project - for a bucket - using
    the generated credentials.

-   Installs all required **network policies**.

**Procedure**:

i. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, you can return to OpenShift Web Console
by using the application launcher icon (the black-and-white icon that looks
like a grid), and choosing the "OpenShift Console" as shown below:

![The NERC OpenShift Web Console Link](images/the-nerc-openshift-web-console-link.png)

ii. From your [NERC's OpenShift Web Console](https://console.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org/),
navigate to your project corresponding to the _NERC RHOAI Data Science Project_
and select the "Import YAML" button, represented by the "+" icon in the top
navigation bar as shown below:

![YAML Add Icon](images/yaml-upload-plus-icon.png)

iii. Verify that you selected the correct project.

![Correct Project Selected for YAML Editor](images/project-verify-yaml-editor.png)

iv. Copy the following code and paste it into the Import YAML editor.

!!! warning "Very Important Note"

    In this YAML file, the size of the storage is set as 10Gi. Change it if
    you need to.

v. Click **Create**.

**Verification**:

i. Once Resource is successfully created, you will see a "Resources successfully
created" message and the following resources listed:

![Resources successfully created Importing More YAML](images/yaml-import-success.png)

ii. Once the deployment is successful, you will be able to see all resources
are created and grouped under "minio" application grouping on the
**Topology View** menu, as shown below:

![MinIO Under Topology](images/minio-topology.png)

Once successfully initiated, click on the **minio** deployment and select the
"Resources" tab to review created *Pods*, *Services*, and *Routes*.

![MinIO Deployemnt Resources](images/minio-deployment-resources.png)

Please note the **minio-console** route URL by navigating to the "Routes" section
under the _Location_ path. When you click on the **minio-console** route URL, it
will open the MinIO web console that looks like below:

![MinIO Web Console](images/minio-web-console.png)

!!! info "MinIO Web Console Login Credential"

    The Username and Password for the MinIO web console can be retrieved from
    the Data Connection's **Access key** and **Secret key**.

iii. Navigate back to the OpenShift AI dashboard.

a. Select Data Science Projects and then click the name of your project, i.e.
**Object Detection Workbench**.

b. Click **Data connections**. You should see one data connection listed:
*My Storage* as shown below:

![Data Connections](images/single-data-connection.png)

c. Verify the buckets are created on the MinIO Web Console:

-   Click on the newly created data connection from the list and then click
the action menu (â‹®) at the end of the selected data connection row. Choose
"Edit data connection" from the dropdown menu. This will open a pop-up
 window as shown below:

    ![Edit Data Connection Pop up](images/edit-data-connection.png)

-   Note both  *Access key* (by clicking eye icon near the end of the textbox) and
*Secret key*.

    !!! note "Alternatively, Run `oc` commands to get *Access key* and *Secret key*"

        Alternatively, you can run the following `oc` commands:

        i. To get *Access key* run:

        `oc get secret minio-root-user -o template --template '{{.data.MINIO_ROOT_USER}}' | base64 --decode`

        ii. And to get *Secret key* run:

        `oc get secret minio-root-user -o template --template '{{.data.MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD}}' | base64 --decode`

-   Return to the **MinIO Web Console** using the provided URL. Enter the
**Access Key** as the **Username** and the **Secret Key** as the **Password**.
This will open the **Object Browser**, where you should verify that the
bucket: **my-storage** is visible as shown below:

    ![MinIO Object Browser](images/minio-single-object-browser.png)

!!! note "Alternatively, Running a script to install local MinIO object storage"

    Alternatively, you can run a script to install local object storage
    buckets and create data connections using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
    For that, you need to install and configure the OpenShift CLI by
    following the [setup instructions](../../openshift/logging-in/setup-the-openshift-cli.md#installing-the-openshift-cli).
    Once the OpenShift CLI is set up, execute the following command to
    install MinIO object storage along with local S3 storage (MinIO) buckets
    and necessary data connections:

    `oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerc-project/object-detection/main/setup/setup-s3.yaml`

!!! tip "Clean Up"

    To delete all resources if not necessary just run `oc delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerc-project/object-detection/main/setup/setup-s3.yaml`
    or `oc delete all,sa,rolebindings,pvc,job -l app=minio`.

!!! danger "Important Note"

    The script is based on a [guide for deploying MinIO](https://ai-on-openshift.io/tools-and-applications/minio/minio/).
    The MinIO-based Object Storage that the script creates is not meant for production usage.

## 2. Creating a workbench and a notebook

### Creating a workbench and selecting a notebook image

**Procedure**:

Prepare your Jupyter notebook server for using a GPU, you need to have:

Select the correct data science project and create workbench, see
[Populate the data science project](../data-science-project/using-projects-the-rhoai.md#populate-the-data-science-project-with-a-workbench)
for more information.

Please ensure that you start your Jupyter notebook server with options as
depicted in the following configuration screen. This screen provides you
with the opportunity to select a notebook image and configure its options,
including the Accelerator and Number of accelerators (GPUs).

![Object detection Workbench Information](images/object-detection-workbench.png)

For our example project, let's name it "Fraud detection". We'll select the
**PyTorch** image with Recommended Version (selected by default), choose
a **Deployment size** of **Medium**, choose **Accelerator** of
**NVIDIA V100 GPU**, **Number of accelerators** as **1**, and allocate
a **Cluster storage** space of **20GB**.

Here, you will use **Environment Variables** to specify the Key/Value pairs related
to the S3-compatible object storage bucket for storing your model.

To add Environment variables please follow the following steps:

i. Click on **"Add variable"**.

ii. Select **"Config Map"** from the dropdown for the environment variable type.

iii. Choose **"Key / Value"** and enter the following keys along with their corresponding
values, which you have retrieved while "Editing data connection":

![Edit Data Connection Pop up](images/edit-data-connection.png)

**Environment Variables**:

    Key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    Value: <Access key>

    Key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    Value: <Secret key>

    Key: AWS_S3_ENDPOINT
    Value: <Endpoint>

    Key: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
    Value: <Region>

    Key: AWS_S3_BUCKET

![Jupyter file browser - object-detection](images/jupyter-file-browser-3.png)

## 3. Data Preparation

In your Jupyter notebook environment, within the root folder path of `object-detection`,
find the Jupyter notebook file `01-data_preparation.ipynb` that demonstrates how
to prepare the dataset within the NERC RHOAI. Please follow the instructions directly
in the notebook environment. To run it you need to double click it and execute
the "Run" button to run all notebook cells at once.

To train the model, we need a dataset containing images of the target classes, along
with their labels and bounding box definitions for object detection. In this
example, we use images from [Google's Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
dataset, focusing on threeclasses: **Bicycle**, **Car**, and **Traffic Sign**.

!!! tip "Using the Class and Image per Class "

    In this example, we selected only a few classes to speed up the process and
    also we are only downloading 300 images per class to limit the processing time.
    However, to achieve a robust YOLOv5 model, it is recommended to train with
    over 1500 images per class, and more then 10,000 instances per class.

We can now randomly split all our images in **train/validate/test**. We will use
here a standard split scheme: *0.75*, *0.125*, *0.125*.

Once you have completed the entire notebook, the dataset will be ready for training!

## 4. Model training

YOLOv5 is pre-trained to recognize various objects. In this guide, we will use
**Transfer Learning** to fine-tune YOLOv5 for identifying a custom set of images.

### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained for one
task is adapted for another related task. Instead of training from scratch, it
utilizes a pre-trained model as a foundation, significantly reducing the need
for data and computing resources. This approach applies learned knowledge from
one problem to another, making it highly effective in fields like natural language
processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

### Training with YOLOv5

For the training step, open the notebook file `02-model_training.ipynb` in the
same Workbench environment and follow the instructions. The notebook will guide
you through experimentation, model training, and testing the model.

In this example, we will train using the smallest base model i.e. YOLOv5 to save
time. However, you can modify the base model and adjust the training hyperparameters
to achieve better results.

**Verification**:

This process will take some time to complete. At the end, it will generate and
save the model `yolov5n.pt` within the root folder path of `object-detection`.

!!! warning "Warning"

    The memory allocated to your Workbench based on selected **Container Size**
    significantly affects the batch size you can use, regardless of your GPU's capacity.

## 5. Preparing a model for deployment

**Procedure**:

In your JupyterLab environment, open the notebook file `03-yolov5_to_onnx.ipynb`.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to store the model and save it in the portable
**ONNX** format from YoloV5 model.

**Verification**:

After completing the notebook steps, verify that the `yolov5n.onnx` file is created
within the root folder path of `object-detection`.

## 6. Save the Model

**Procedure**:

In your JupyterLab environment, open the notebook file `04-save_model.ipynb` and
follow the instructions. This notebook will guide you through saving the model
to S3-compatible object storage, corresponding to the **My Storage** data connection,
which was set up in [this step](#1-storing-data-with-connection).

**Verification**:

After completing the notebook steps, verify that the `models/yolov5n.onnx` file
is stored in the object storage. Once saved, the model is now ready for use by
your model server.

## 7. Deploying and testing a model

### Deploying a model

Now that the model is stored and saved in the portable **ONNX** format, you can
deploy it as an API using an OpenShift AI **Model Server**.

#### Deploying a model on a multi-model server

NERC RHOAI multi-model servers can host multiple models simultaneously. You can
create a new model server and deploy your model to it.

**Procedure**:

In the OpenShift AI dashboard, navigate to the data science project details page
and click the **Models and model servers** tab.

Select **Add server** as shown below:

![Add A Model Server](images/add-a-model-server.png)

In the pop-up window that appears, depicted as shown below, you can specify the
following details:

For **Model server name**, type a name, for example **Model Server**.

For **Serving runtime**, select **OpenVINO Model Server**.

Leave the other fields with the default settings.

![Create model server form](images/create-model-server-form.png)

Click **Add**.

In the **Models and model servers** list, next to the new model server, click
**Deploy** model.

![Create model server form](images/ds-project-workbench-list-deploy.png)

In the form, provide the following values:

For **Model deployment name**, type **yolo**.

For **Model framework (name - version)**, select **onnx-1**.

For **Existing connection**, select **My Storage**.

Type the path that leads to the version folder that contains your model file: **models**

Leave the other fields with the default settings.

![Deploy model from for multi-model serving](images/deploy-model-form-od.png)

Click **Deploy**.

**Verification**:

When you return to the Deployed models page, you will see your newly deployed model.
You should click on the 1 on the Deployed models tab to see details. Notice the
loading symbol under the Status section. When the model has finished deploying,
the status icon will be a **green checkmark** indicating the model deployment is
complete as shown below:

![Deployed model status](images/ds-project-model-list-status-mm.png)

When you return to the Deployed models page, you will see your newly deployed model.
You should click on the 1 on the Deployed models tab to see details. Notice the
loading symbol under the Status section. When the model has finished deploying,
the status icon will be a **green checkmark** indicating the model deployment is
complete as shown below:

![Deployed model status](images/ds-project-model-list-status-od.png)

### Testing the model API

Now that you've deployed the model, you can test its API endpoints.

**Procedure**:

-   In the OpenShift AI dashboard, navigate to the project details page and click
the **Models** tab.

-   Take note of the model's Inference endpoint URL. You need this information when
you test the model API.

    ![Deployed Model Serving Inference Endpoints](images/deploy-model-inference-endpoints-od.png)

    The **Inference endpoint** field contains an **Internal Service** link, click
    the link to open a popup that shows the URL details, and then take note of
    the **grpcUrl** and **restUrl** values.

-   Return to the Jupyter notebook environment and test your new inference endpoints.

    To make a gRPC API call, follow the instructions in `05-remote_inference_grpc.ipynb`,
    updating the *grpc_host* with your own **grpcUrl** value (as noted above).

    Follow the instructions in `06-remote_inference_rest.ipynb` to make a REST
    API call. Be sure to update the *rest_url* with your own **restUrl** value (as
    noted above).

    ![Object Detection Application Using YOLOv5 Model](images/object-detection-result.png)

    !!! note "Note"

        The notebook provides an example for processing a single image and also
        demonstrates batch processing for multiple images from the **images** folder.
        This enables a basic benchmark to measure processing and inference time.

## Deploy the Model Application on NERC OpenShift

The **model application** includes a visual user interface (UI) powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/),
allowing users to interact with the [trained model](#4-model-training). This
interface enables users to upload images and interact with machine learning models
seamlessly. This app communicates with a remote model inference service via a
REST API to process images and generate predictions about the objects in the
uploaded image.

The model application code is located in the `"application"` folder within the
root directory of `object-detection`. You can find this folder in the **GitHub repository**
you cloned during the step: [Importing the tutorial files into the Jupyter environment](#importing-the-tutorial-files-into-the-jupyter-environment).

![Model Application Folder](images/Model_Application_Folder_object-detection.png)

If you look inside it `app.py`, you will find two crucial lines of
code for retrieving environment variables:

```python
# Get a few environment variables. These are so we:
# - Know what endpoint we should request
# - Set server name and port for Streamlit
MODEL_NAME = os.getenv("MODEL_NAME", "yolo")    <----------
REST_URL = os.getenv("INFERENCE_ENDPOINT")    <----------
INFER_URL = f"{REST_URL}/v2/models/{MODEL_NAME}/infer"
...

    infer = ort_v5(uploaded_image_path, INFER_URL, ...)    <----------
```

This is how you send a request to the NERC RHOAI Model Server with the user uploaded
image to process for a prediction.

We will deploy the application on OpenShift by linking it to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nerc-project/object-detection).
OpenShift will fetch the repository, build a container image using the **Dockerfile**,
and publish it automatically.

To accomplish this, from the OpenShift AI dashboard, navigate to the OpenShift Web
Console:

![The NERC OpenShift Web Console Link](images/the-nerc-openshift-web-console-link.png)

Ensure you are in **Developer** view and have selected the correct data science
project. Then, click on "**+Add**" in the left menu and select "**Import from Git**".

![Import from Git](images/Import_from_Git.png)

In the "Git Repo URL" enter: `https://github.com/nerc-project/object-detection` (this
is the same repository you [pulled into RHOAI earlier](#importing-the-tutorial-files-into-the-jupyter-environment)).
Then press "Show advanced Git options" and set "Context dir" to "/application"
where the application **Dockerfile** is located as shown below:

![Import Git Repo With Dockerfile](images/import_object_detection_git_repo.png)

At the **General** section, select "Create application" option under **Application**
and then give unique **Application name** i.e. `object-detection-application` and
also **Name** i.e. `object-detection-application` as shown below:

![General Application Information](images/general-object-detection-application-info.png)

Finally, at the **Deploy** section, press "Show advanced Deployment option".

Set these values in the **Environment variables (runtime only)** fields:

![Deployment Options](images/deploy-object-detection-advance-option.png)

**Name**: *MODEL_NAME*

**Value**: From the RHOAI projects interface ([from the previous section](#testing-the-model-api)),
copy the **Model name** value. For example: `yolo`.

**Name**: *INFERENCE_ENDPOINT*

**Value**: From the RHOAI projects interface ([from the previous section](#testing-the-model-api)),
copy the **restUrl** value. For example: `http://modelmesh-serving.<your-namespace>:8008`.

![Deployed Model Serving Inference Endpoints](images/deploy-model-inference-endpoints.png)

Your full settings page should look something like this:

![Import from Git Settings](images/Import_from_Git_object_detection-settings.png)

!!! note "Target Port"

    Under "Advanced options," make sure to set the **Target Port** to **8501**,
    which corresponds to the exposed port in the application's [Dockerfile](https://github.com/nerc-project/object-detection/blob/main/application/Dockerfile#L19).

Press **Create** to start deploying the application.

You should now see a new object is added in your topology map for the application
that you just added. When the circle of your deployment turns dark blue it means
that it has finished deploying.

If you want more details on how the deployment is going, you can press the circle
and look at **Resources** in the right menu that opens up. There you can see how
the build is going and what's happening to the pod.

![Object Detection Deployment Resources](images/object_detection_deployment_resources.png)

The application will be ready when the build is complete and the pod is "Running".

When the application has been deployed successfully, you can either open the
application URL using the **Open URL** icon as shown below or you can naviate to
the route URL by navigating to the "Routes" section under the _Location_ path as
shown below:

![Application deployed](images/object-detection-application_deployed.png)

This will open the application interface in a new tab.

Congratulations, you now have an application running your AI model!

Try uploading your own image by browsing or dragging and dropping a file  
(*.jpg,*.png, or *.jpeg only*) to see if the app can accurately predict and
label objects in it.
