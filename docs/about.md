# About NERC

We are currently in the pilot phase of the project and are focusing on
developing the technology to make it easy for researchers to take advantage of
a suite of services (**IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**) that are not readily available
today. This includes:

1. The creation of the building blocks needed for production cloud services
2. Begin collaboration with Systems Engineers from other institutions with well
established RC groups
3. On-board select proof of concept use cases from institutions within the
[MGHPCC consortium](https://www.mghpcc.org/resources/) and other institutions
within Massachusetts

The longer term objectives will be centered around activities that will focus on:

1. Engaging with various OpenStack communities by sharing best practices and
setting standards for deployments
2. Connecting regularly with the [Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/)
(MOC) leadership to understand when new technologies they are developing with
RedHat, Inc. – and as part of the new NSF funded [Open Cloud Testbed](https://
assopen.cloud/connected-initiatives/open-cloud-testbed) – might be ready for
adoption into the production NERC environment
3. Broadening the local deployment team of NERC to include partner universities
within the MGHPCC consortium.

*Figure 1: NERC Overview*

NERC production services (*red*) stand on top of the existing NESE storage
services (*blue*) that are built on the strong foundation of MGHPCC (*green*) that
provides core facility and network access. The Innovation Hub (*grey*) enables
new technologies to be rapidly adopted by the NERC or NESE services. On the
far left (*purple*) are the Research and Learning communities which are the
primary customers of NERC. As users proceed down the stack of production
services from Web-apps, that require more technical skills, the Cloud
Facilitators (*orange*) in the middle guide and educate users on how to best
use the services.
