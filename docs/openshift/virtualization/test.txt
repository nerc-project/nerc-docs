Course Outline
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
Distinguish Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization from container technologies and from traditional virtual machine technologies. Describe the features and use cases of OpenShift Virtualization. Deploy the OpenShift Virtualization operator in an existing Red Hat OpenShift environment.
Running and Accessing Virtual Machines
Create, manage, inspect, and monitor virtual machines in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.
Configuring Kubernetes Networking for Virtual Machines
Configure standard Kubernetes network objects and external access for VMs and virtual machine-backed applications.
Connecting Virtual Machines to External Networks
Configure node networking to connect virtual machines and nodes to networks outside of the cluster by using Multus CNI plug-ins and the NMState operator.
Configuring Storage for Virtual Machines
Manage storage and disks for virtual machines in Red Hat OpenShift by using Kubernetes.
Create and Restore Backups of Virtual Machines
Create virtual machine snapshots and back up virtual machine components individually and by using the OpenShift APIs for Data Protection (OADP) operator.
Replicating Virtual Machines by Using Instance Types, Templates, and Clones
Create and manage clones, templates, and instance types to provision virtual machines.
Advanced Virtual Machine Management
Import, control the placement of, monitor the health of, and live migrate virtual machines.
Configuring Kubernetes High Availability for Virtual Machines
Implement high availability virtual machines that are resilient to failures, planned maintenance, and cluster upgrades by configuring Kubernetes resources.

Creating a virtual machine documents basic VM creation: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/creating-a-virtual-machine#virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types

Advanced VM creation documents advanced ways to create VMs: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/advanced-vm-creation#advanced-vm-creation-overview

Managing VMs documents all procedures relevant to managing VMs, both basic and advanced: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/managing-vms#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent

[Create a VM from a Red Hat image](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/advanced-vm-creation#virt-creating-vms-from-rh-images-overview).

You can create a VM by using a Red Hat template or an [instance type](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/creating-a-virtual-machine#virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types).

You can create a VM by [importing a custom image from a container registry or a web page, by uploading an image from your local machine](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/advanced-vm-creation#virt-creating-vms-from-web-images), or by [cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC)](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/advanced-vm-creation#virt-creating-vms-by-cloning-pvcs).

Connect a VM to a secondary network:

-   [Linux bridge network](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/networking#virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge).

-   [Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/networking#virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network).

-   [Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/networking#virt-connecting-vm-to-sriov).


!!! note "Note"

    VMs are connected to the pod network by default.

Connect to a VM:

Creating a virtual machine: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/creating-a-virtual-machine#virt-about-instance-types_virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types

Connect to the serial console or VNC console of a VM.
Connect to a VM by using SSH.
Connect to the desktop viewer for Windows VMs.
Manage a VM:

Manage a VM by using the web console.
Manage a VM by using the virtctl CLI tool.
Export a VM.

Following standard Red Hat OpenShift roles, users can create virtual machines in their
projects—and then grant access to other project members—to help their entire team
quickly get the resources they need. [Virtual machine instance types](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/virtualization/virtual-machines#virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types)

Pre-defined instance types:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/creating-a-virtual-machine#virt-common-instancetypes_virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types

simplify self-service
provisioning via predefined operating system images, workload types, and hardware
requirements. You can also use [templates](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/virtualization/virtual-machines#doc-wrapper) to deploy virtual machines that require
advanced configuration, including virtual appliances.
