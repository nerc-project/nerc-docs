# Tunnelblick

Tunnelblick is a free, open-source GUI (graphical user interface) for OpenVPN
on macOS and OS X: More details can be found [here](https://tunnelblick.net/).
Access to a VPN server  -  your computer is one end of the tunnel and the VPN
server is the other end.

## Find your client account credentials

You need to contact your project administrator to get your own OpenVPN
configuration file (file with .ovpn extension). Download it and Keep it in your
local machine so in next steps we can use this configuration client profile file.

## Download and install Tunnelblick

1. Download [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/index.html), a free and
   user-friendly app for managing OpenVPN connections on macOS.
