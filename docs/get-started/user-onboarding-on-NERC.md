# User Onboarding Process Overview

NERC’s Research allocations are available to faculty members and researchers, including
postdoctoral researchers and students, at a U.S. based institution in New England.
In order to get access to resources provided by NERC’s computational infrastructure,
you must first register and obtain a user account.

The overall user flow can be summarized using the following sequence diagram:

![NERC user flow](images/user-flow-NERC.png)

1. All users including PI need to register to NERC via: [https://regapp.mss.mghpcc.org/](https://regapp.mss.mghpcc.org/).

2. **PI** will send a request for a Principal Investigator (PI) user account role
by submitting: [NERC's PI Request Form](https://nerc.mghpcc.org/pi-account-request/).

    !!! question "Principal Investigator Eligibility Information"
        - MGHPCC consortium members, whereby they enter into an service agreement
        with MGHPCC for the NERC services.

        - Non-members of MGHPCC can also be PIs of NERC Services, but must also have an active non-member agreement with MGHPCC.

        - External research focused institutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are subject to an external customer cost structure.

3. Wait until the PI request gets approved by the **NERC’s admin**.

4. Once a PI request is **approved**, **PI** can add a new project and also search
and add user(s) to the project - Other **general user(s)** can also see the project(s)
once they are added to a project via: [https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/).

5. **PI or project Manager** can request resource allocation for the newly added
project and select which user(s) can use the requested allocation.*

6. Wait until the requested resource allocation gets approved by the **NERC’s admin**.

7. Once **approved**, **PI and the corresponding project users** can go to NERC
Openstack horizon web interface:
[https://stack.nerc.mghpcc.org](https://stack.nerc.mghpcc.org) and they can start
using the NERC’s OpenStack resources based on the project **quotas**.
