We are currently in the pilot phase of the project and are focusing on
developing the technology to make it easy for researchers to take advantage of
a suite of services (**IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**) that are not readily available
today. This includes:

1. The creation of the building blocks needed for production cloud services

2. Begin collaboration with Systems Engineers from other institutions with well
   established RC groups

3. On-board select proof of concept use cases from institutions within the
   [MGHPCC consortium](https://www.mghpcc.org/resources/) and other institutions
   within Massachusetts

The longer term objectives will be centered around activities that will focus on:

1. Engaging with various OpenStack communities by sharing best practices and
   setting standards for deployments

2. Connecting regularly with the [Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/)
   (MOC) leadership to understand when new technologies they are developing with
   RedHat, Inc. – and as part of the new NSF funded [Open Cloud Testbed](https://
   massopen.cloud/connected-initiatives/open-cloud-testbed) – might be ready for
   adoption into the production NERC environment

3. Broadening the local deployment team of NERC to include partner universities
   within the MGHPCC consortium.

_Figure 1: NERC Overview_

NERC production services (_red_) stand on top of the existing NESE storage
services (_blue_) that are built on the strong foundation of MGHPCC (_green_) that
provides core facility and network access. The Innovation Hub (_grey_) enables
new technologies to be rapidly adopted by the NERC or NESE services. On the
far left (_purple_) are the Research and Learning communities which are the
primary customers of NERC. As users proceed down the stack of production
services from Web-apps, that require more technical skills, the Cloud
Facilitators (_orange_) in the middle guide and educate users on how to best
use the services.
