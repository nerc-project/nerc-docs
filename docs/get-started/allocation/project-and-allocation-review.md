# Project and Individual Allocation Annual Review Process

## Project Annual Review Process

NERC's ColdFront allows annual project reviews for NERC admins by mandating PIs
to assess and update their projects. With the Project Review feature activated,
each project undergoes a mandatory review every 365 days. During this process,
PIs update project details, confirm project members, and input publications,
grants, and research outcomes from the preceding year.

!!! danger "Required Project Review"

    The PI or any manager(s) of a project must complete the project review once
    every 365 days. ColdFront does not send notifications to PIs when project reviews
    are due. Instead, when the PI or Manager(s) of a project views their project
    they will find the notification that the project review is due. Additionally,
    when the project review is pending, PIs or Project Manager(s) cannot request
    new allocations or renew expiring allocations or change request to update the
    allocated allocation attributes' values. This is to enforce PIs need to
    review their projects annually. The PI or any managers on the project are
    able to complete the project review process.

### Project Reviews by PIs or Project Manager(s)

When a PI or any Project Manager(s) of a project logs into NERC's ColdFront web
console and their project review is due, they will see a banner next to the
project name on the home page:

![Project Review](images/coldfront-project-review.png)

If they try to request a new allocation or renew an expiring allocation or change
request to update the allocated allocation attributes' values, they will get an
error message:

![Project Review Pending Notification](images/coldfront-project-review-notifications.png)

### Project Review Steps

When they click on the "Review Project" link they're presented with the requirements
and a description of why we're asking for this update:

![Project Review Submit Details](images/coldfront-project-review-steps.png)

The links in each step direct them to different parts of their Project Detail page.
This review page lists the dates when grants and publications were last updated.
If there are no grant or publications or at least one of them hasn't been udpated
in the last year, we ask for a reason they're not updating the project information.
This helps encourage PIs to provide updates if they have them. If not, they
provide a reason and this is displayed for the NERC admins as part of the review
process.

Once the project review page is completed, the PI is redirected to the project
detail page and they see the status change to "project review pending".

## Allocation Renewals

When the requested allocation is approved, it must have an "End Date" - which
is normally 365 days or 1 year from the date it is approved i.e. "Start Date".
Automated emails are triggered to all users on an allocation when the end date
is 60 days away, 30 days, 7 days, and then set the allocation status to
"**Active (Needs Renewal)**", unless the user turns off notifications on the project.

!!! danger "Very Important: Urgent Allocation Renewal is Required Before End Date"

    If the allocation renewal isn't processed prior to the original allocation
    end date by the PI or Manager, the allocation will set the allocation status
    to "Active (Needs Renewal)" and the allocation users will get a notification
    email letting them know the allocation needs renewal!

    ![Allocation Renewal Prior End Date](images/renew_expiring_allocation.png)

    Currently, a project will continue to be able to utilize allocations even after
    the allocation end date, which will result in ongoing **costs** for you. Such
    allocation will be marked as "Active (Needs Renewal)" as shown below:

    ![Allocation Needs Renewal After End Date](images/needs_renew_allocation.png)

Allocation renewals may not require any additions or changes to the allocation
attributes from the PI or Manager. By default, if the PI or Manager clicks on
the 'Activate' button, as shown below:

![ColdFront Activate Expiring Allocation](images/coldfront-activate-expiring-allocation.png)

Then it will prompt for confirmation and allow the admin to review and submit the
activation request by clicking on 'Submit' button, as shown below:

![ColdFront Allocation Renewal Submit](images/coldfront-submit-allocation-activation.png)

Emails are sent to all allocation users letting them know the renewal request has
been submitted.

Then the allocation status will change to "Renewal Requested" as shown below:

![ColdFront Allocation Renewal Requested](images/coldfront-allocation-renewal-requested.png)

Once the renewal request is reviewed and approved by NERC admins, it will change
into "Active" status and the expiration date is set to another 365 days as shown
below:

![ColdFront Allocation Renewal Successful](images/coldfront-renewed-allocation.png)

Then an automated email notification will be sent to the PI and all users on the
allocation that have enabled email notifications.

## Cost Associated with Allocations that Need Renewal after "End Date"

Currently, a project will continue be able to utilize allocations even after their
"End Date", resulting in ongoing **costs** for you. Such allocations will be
marked as "Active (Needs Renewal)". In the future, we plan to change this behavior
so that allocations after end date will prevent associated VMs/pods from starting
and may cause active VMs/pods to cease running.
