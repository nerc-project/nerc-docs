# Persistent Storage

## Ephemeral disk

OpenStack offers two types of block storage: ephemeral storage and persistent volumes.
Ephemeral storage is available only during the instance's lifespan, persisting
across guest operating system reboots. However, once the instance is deleted,
its associated storage is also removed. The size of ephemeral storage is determined
by the virtual machine's flavor and remains constant for all virtual machines of
that flavor. The service level for ephemeral storage relies on the underlying hardware.

In its default configuration, when the instance is launched from an **Image** or
an **Instance Snapshot**, the choice for utilizing persistent storage is configured
by selecting the **Yes** option for "Create New Volume". Additionally, the "Delete
Volume on Instance Delete" setting is pre-set to **No** as shown below:

![Instance Persistent Storage Option](images/instance-persistent-storage-option.png)

If you set the **"Create New Volume"** option to **No**, the instance will boot
from either an image or a snapshot, with the instance only being attached to an
ephemeral disk. It's crucial to note that this configuration does **NOT** create
persistent block storage in the form of a Volume, which can pose risks. Consequently,
the disk of the instance won't appear in the "Volumes" list. To mitigate potential
data loss, we strongly recommend regularly [taking a snapshot](../backup/backup-with-snapshots.md#create-and-use-instance-snapshots)
of such a running ephemeral instance, referred to as an **"instance snapshot"**,
especially if you want to safeguard or recover important states of your instance.

!!! danger "Very Important Note"

    Never use **Ephemeral disk** if you're setting up a production-level environment.
    When the instance is deleted, its associated ephemeral storage is also removed.

## Volumes

A volume is a detachable block storage device, similar to a USB hard drive. You
can attach a volume to only one instance.

Unlike Ephemeral disk, Volumes are the Block Storage devices that you attach to
instances to enable persistent storage. Users can attach a volume to a running
instance or detach a volume and attach it to another instance at any time.

Ownership of volumes can be transferred to another project by transferring it to
another project as [described here](../persistent-storage/transfer-a-volume.md).

Some uses for volumes:

- Persistent data storage for ephemeral instances.

- Transfer of data between projects

- Bootable image where disk changes persist

- Mounting the disk of one instance to another for troubleshooting

## How do you make your VM setup and data persistent?

- By default, when the instance is launched from an **Image** or an
  **Instance Snapshot**, the choice for utilizing persistent storage is configured
  by selecting the **Yes** option for **"Create New Volume"**. It's crucial to
  note that this configuration automatically creates persistent block storage
  in the form of a Volume instead of using Ephemeral disk, which appears in
  the "Volumes" list in the Horizon dashboard: _Project -> Volumes -> Volumes_.

- By default, the setting for **"Delete Volume on Instance Delete"** is configured
  to use **No**. This setting ensures that the volume created during the launch
  of a virtual machine remains persistent and won't be deleted alongside the
  instance unless explicitly chosen as "Yes". Such instances boot from a
  **bootable volume**, utilizing an existing volume listed in the
  _Project -> Volumes -> Volumes_ menu.

To minimize the risk of potential data loss, we highly recommend consistently
[creating backups through snapshots](../backup/backup-with-snapshots.md).
You can opt for a **"volume snapshot"** if you only need to capture the volume's
data. However, if your VM involves extended running processes and vital
in-memory data, preserving the precise VM state is essential. In such cases,
we recommend regularly taking a snapshot of the entire instance, known as an
**"instance snapshot"**, provided you have sufficient Volume **Storage quotas**,
specifically the "OpenStack Volume Quota (GiB)" allocated for [your resource allocation](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-details.md#general-user-view-of-openstack-resource-allocation).
Please ensure that your allocation includes sufficient quota for the "OpenStack
Number of Volumes Quota" to allow for the creation of additional volumes based on
your quota attributes. Utilizing snapshots for backups is of utmost importance,
particularly when safeguarding or recovering critical states and data from your
instance.

!!! danger "Very Important: Requested/Approved Allocated Storage Quota and Cost"

    When you [delete virtual machines](../decommission/decommission-openstack-resources.md#delete-all-vms)
    backed by persistent volumes, the disk data is retained, continuing to consume
    approved storage resources for which you will still be billed. It's important
    to note that the **Storage quotas** for **NERC (OpenStack)** Resource Allocations,
    are specified by the "OpenStack Volume Quota (GiB)" and "OpenStack Swift Quota
    (GiB)" allocation attributes. Storage cost is determined by
    [your requested and approved allocation values](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-details.md#pi-and-manager-allocation-view-of-openstack-resource-allocation)
    to reserve storage from the total NESE storage pool.

    If you request additional storage by specifying a changed quota value for
    the "OpenStack Volume Quota (GiB)" and "OpenStack Swift Quota (GiB)"
    allocation attributes through [NERC's ColdFront interface](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/),
    invoicing for the extra storage will take place upon fulfillment or approval
    of your request, as explained in our
    [Billing FAQs](../../get-started/cost-billing/billing-faqs.md).

    Conversely, if you request a reduction in the **Storage quotas** by specifying
    a reduced quota value for the "OpenStack Volume Quota (GiB)" and "OpenStack Swift
    Quota in Gigabytes" allocation attributes through a [change request using ColdFront](../../get-started/allocation/allocation-change-request.md#request-change-resource-allocation-attributes-for-openstack-project),
    your invoicing will be adjusted accordingly when the request is submitted.

    In both scenarios, 'invoicing' refers to the accumulation of hours
    corresponding to the added or removed storage quantity.
