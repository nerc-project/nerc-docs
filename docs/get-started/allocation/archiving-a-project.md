# Archiving an Existing Project

Only a **PI** can archive [their ColdFront project(s)](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/project/)
by accessing [NERC's ColdFront interface](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/).

!!! danger "Important Note"

    If you archive a project then this will expire all your allocations on that
    project, which will clean up and also disable your group's access to the resources
    in those allocations. Also, you cannot make any changes to archived projects.

Once archived it is no longer visible on [your projects list](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/project/).
All archived projects will be listed under [your archived projects](https://coldfront.mss.mghpcc.org/project/archived/),
which can be viewed by clicking the "View archived projects" button, as shown below:
