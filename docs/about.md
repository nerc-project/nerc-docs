# About NERC

We are currently in the pilot phase of the project and are focusing on developing the technology to make it easy for researchers to take advantage of a suite of services (**IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**) that are not readily available today.  This includes:

1. The creation of the building blocks needed for production cloud services
2. Begin collaboration with Systems Engineers from other institutions with well established RC groups
3. On-board select proof of concept use cases from institutions within the [MGHPCC consortium](https://www.mghpcc.org/resources/) and other institutions within Massachusetts

The longer term objectives will be centered around activities that will focus on:

1. Engaging with various OpenStack communities by sharing best practices and setting standards for deployments
2. Connecting regularly with the [Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/) (MOC) leadership to understand when new technologies they are developing with RedHat, Inc. – and as part of the new NSF funded [Open Cloud Testbed](https://massopen.cloud/connected-initiatives/open-cloud-testbed) – might be ready for adoption into the production NERC environment
3. Broadening the local deployment team of NERC to include partner universities within the MGHPCC consortium.

NERC production services (*red*) stand on top of the existing NESE storage services (*blue*) are built on the strong foundation of MGHPCC (*green*) that provides core facility and network access.  The Innovation Hub (*grey*) enables new technologies to be rapidly adopted by the NERC or NESE services.  On the far left (*purple*) are the Research and Learning communities which are the primary customers of NERC.  As users proceed down the stack of production services from Web-apps, that require more technical skills, the Cloud Facilitators (*orange*) in the middle guide and educate users on how to best use the services.
