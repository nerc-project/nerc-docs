# Managing Users in the Project Resource Allocation

When the PI or Project Manager(s) view the **Allocation Detail** page of a project
by clicking the corresponding allocation under the **Allocations** section on
the Project Detail page, they will see options to add or remove users under
the **Users in Allocation** section, as shown below:

## Adding User(s) to a Project Resource Allocation

Any available users who were previously added to a project but not yet included
in the selected allocation can be easily added by clicking the **Add Users** button.

After clicking, the following interface will appear, allowing PIs or Project
Manager(s) to select the desired users using the checkboxes and then click
the **Add Selected Users to Allocation** button:

!!! warning "Very Important"

    The desired user must already be on the project to be added to the allocation.

## Removing User(s) from a Project Resource Allocation

Removing User(s) from the Resource Allocation is straightforward by just clicking
on the "Remove Users" button. Then it shows the following interface:

PI or project managers can select the user(s) on the checkboxes and then click on
the "Remove Selected Users From Project" button.

!!! note "Very Important"

    If you remove a user (or users) from an allocation, they will be removed
    **only** from that specific allocation. They will still remain part of any
    other allocation(s) they are assigned to and will continue to be available
    as users within the project. You can remove the user(s) from all allocations
    of a project by removing them from the project as [explained here](manage-users-to-a-project.md#remove-users-from-a-project).
